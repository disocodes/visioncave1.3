# Visioncave - Advanced AI-Powered NVR with Natural Language Video Understanding

A sophisticated Network Video Recorder (NVR) system that combines state-of-the-art object detection with natural language video understanding. Built on top of the excellent Frigate NVR, Visioncave adds powerful new capabilities:

## Key Features

- Support for multiple object detection models including YOLOv9
- Natural language video querying powered by Vision-Language Models (VLM)
- Advanced video search and retrieval using natural language
- All the great features from Frigate:
  - Integration with Home Assistant
  - Local AI object detection
  - Efficient resource usage
  - Motion-based detection
  - MQTT communication
  - 24/7 recording
  - RTSP re-streaming
  - WebRTC & MSE support

## New AI Capabilities

### Multiple Detection Models
- Support for YOLOv9 and other YOLO variants
- Easy model switching and comparison
- Custom model training support

### Vision-Language Understanding
- Natural language video querying
- Semantic search across recorded footage
- Advanced scene understanding and description
- Temporal event querying (e.g., "Show me when someone approached the door with a package")
